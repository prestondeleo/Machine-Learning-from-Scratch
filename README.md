# NeuralNetworksFromScratch
The following repository contains various types of neural networks implemented from scratch.

learner.py implements gradient descent to learn a desicision boundary on iris data set on classes of versicolor and virginica. This is done via a single-layer classifier "perceptron". Includes plots of optimizing decision boundary and iterations vs learning curves. Shows use of random wieghts vs preset weights.
